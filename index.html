<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>this is just a junkyard of ideas I'm flirting with right now, but this page will become really interesting really soon, I promise!</p>
<p>I'm currently studying at Harvard and interning at Microsoft. I'm really into computational cognitive science, contemporary music composition, languages, and, newly, putting yourself on the internet. </p>	
<p> Would make my day if you said hello! </p>
